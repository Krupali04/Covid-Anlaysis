# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 by utilizing datasets on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. The goal was to derive meaningful insights from the data and present them in an interactive and visually appealing format.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Import and Exploration
 
The COVID-19 deaths dataset and COVID-19 vaccination dataset were imported and explored using SQL.
Initial data exploration included cleaning, transformation, and joining of datasets to prepare for further analysis.

2. SQL Views for Analysis
 
Created necessary SQL views to aggregate and summarize data.
Prepared structured tables to focus on key metrics, such as vaccination rates, death counts, and trends over time.

3. Visualization in Tableau

Imported SQL views into Tableau for data visualization.

Designed an interactive dashboard to provide insights into:
Global vaccination trends.
Regional differences in vaccination coverage and death rates.
Correlation between vaccination progress and reduction in death rates.
